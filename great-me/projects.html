          <h3>Tech Education Website</h3>
          <p>
             I came up with a web page where learners who are ambitious of learning tech courses can be able to apply, learn and receive certificates after completion.
             <p>The website contains different pages like:
                <p><h5>1. login page:</h5> where learners can be able to get into the website after they log out
                <p></p><h5>2. registration page:</h5> where new learners can be able to enter into the website and have access to the courses available.
                <p></p><h5>3. course catalog page:</h5> where learners can be able to see all the available courses and they durations.
                 <p></p><h5>4. course-details page:</h5> where every course a learner wants to enroll in is described well showing it's course contents that a learner does when enrolled.
                 <p></p><h5>5. certification page:</h5> where learner can be able to see his/her awarded certificate and be able to download them.
                 <p></p><h5>6. feedback page:</h5> where learners can give they feedbacks about the course they enrolled in and the website in general.</p>
